# Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer) Samples (Windows)

Samples are simple applications that demonstrate how to use DL Streamer on Windows systems.

## Available Samples

The samples are available in two categories:

1. gst_launch command-line samples (samples construct GStreamer pipeline via [gst-launch-1.0](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tools/gst-launch.html) command-line utility)
    * [Face Detection And Classification Sample](./gst_launch/face_detection_and_classification/README.md) - constructs object detection and classification pipeline example with [gvadetect](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvadetect.html) and [gvaclassify](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvaclassify.html) elements to detect faces and estimate age, gender, emotions and landmark points
    * [Audio Event Detection Sample](./gst_launch/audio_detect/README.md) - constructs audio event detection pipeline example with [gvaaudiodetect](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvaaudiodetect.html) element and uses [gvametaconvert](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvametaconvert.html), [gvametapublish](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvametapublish.html) elements to convert audio event metadata with inference results into JSON format and to print on standard out
    * [Detection with Yolo](./gst_launch/detection_with_yolo/README.md) - demonstrates how to use publicly available YOLO models for object detection with/without hardware acceleration
    * [Human Pose Estimation Sample](./gst_launch/human_pose_estimation/README.md) - demonstrates human pose estimation using full-frame inference with [gvaclassify](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvaclassify.html) element to detect pose keypoints
    * [Instance Segmentation Sample](./gst_launch/instance_segmentation/README.md) - demonstrates instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN models to detect objects and generate pixel-level segmentation masks
    * [License Plate Recognition Sample](./gst_launch/license_plate_recognition/README.md) - demonstrates automatic license plate detection and OCR using cascaded inference with YOLOv8 detection and PaddleOCR recognition
    * [Vehicle and Pedestrian Tracking Sample](./gst_launch/vehicle_pedestrian_tracking/README.md) - demonstrates object detection, tracking, and classification pipeline using [gvadetect](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvadetect.html), [gvatrack](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvatrack.html), and [gvaclassify](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvaclassify.html) elements
    * [Image Embeddings Generation with ViT](./gst_launch/lvm/README.md) - demonstrates how to generate image embeddings using the Vision Transformer component of a CLIP model
    * [GVAAttachROI Sample](./gst_launch/gvaattachroi/README.md) - demonstrates using [gvaattachroi](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvaattachroi.html) element to define regions of interest (ROI) for selective inference, allowing detection in specific areas of video frames
    * [Metadata Publishing Sample](./gst_launch/metapublish/README.md) - demonstrates how to publish inference metadata to files, MQTT, or Kafka using [gvametaconvert](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvametaconvert.html) and [gvametapublish](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer/elements/gvametapublish.html) elements
    * [Multi-Stream Processing Sample](./gst_launch/multi_stream/README.md) - demonstrates parallel processing of multiple video streams with model instance sharing for efficient memory usage across CPU, GPU, and NPU devices
    * [Video Summarization with VLM Models (gvagenai)](./gst_launch/gvagenai/README.md) - demonstrates video summarization with visual language models (MiniCPM-V, Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, Gemma 3) using the gvagenai element and OpenVINO™ GenAI
2. Benchmark
    * [Benchmark Sample](./benchmark/README.md) - measures overall performance of single-channel or multi-channel video analytics pipelines

## How To Build And Run

Samples provide `.bat` script for constructing and executing gst-launch command line on Windows.

## DL Models

DL Streamer samples use pre-trained models from OpenVINO™ Toolkit [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo)

Before running the samples, run the `download_omz_models.bat` script once to download all models required for samples. The script is located in the `samples\windows` folder.

> **NOTE**: To install all necessary requirements for `download_omz_models.bat` script run this command:
>
> ```batch
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
> python -m pip install openvino-dev[onnx]
> ```

## Input video

First command-line parameter in DL Streamer samples specifies input video and supports:

* local video file (`C:\path\to\video.mp4`)
* web camera device (Windows USB camera path format, uses `ksvideosrc` element)
* RTSP camera (URL starting with `rtsp://`) or other streaming source (ex URL starting with `http://`)

If command-line parameter is not specified, most samples by default stream the video example from a predefined HTTPS link, so an internet connection is required.

> **NOTE**: Most samples set property `sync=false` in video sink element to disable real-time synchronization and run pipeline as fast as possible. Change to `sync=true` to run pipeline with real-time speed.
