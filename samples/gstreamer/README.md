## How To Build And Run

Samples with C/C++ code provide `build_and_run.sh` shell script to build application via cmake before execution.

Other samples (without C/C++ code) provide .sh script for constructing and executing gst-launch or Python command line.

## DL Models

DL Streamer samples use pre-trained models from OpenVINO™ Toolkit [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo)

Before running samples, run script `download_omz_models.sh` once to download all models required for samples. The script located in `samples` top folder.
> **NOTE**: To install all necessary requirements for `download_omz_models.sh` script run this command:
```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install openvino-dev[onnx]
```
> **NOTE**: To install all available frameworks run this command:
```sh
python3 -m pip install openvino-dev[caffe,onnx,tensorflow2,pytorch,mxnet]
```

## Input video

First command-line parameter in DL Streamer samples specifies input video and supports
* local video file
* web camera device (ex. `/dev/video0`)
* RTSP camera (URL starting with `rtsp://`) or other streaming source (ex URL starting with `http://`)

If command-line parameter not specified, most samples by default stream video example from predefined HTTPS link, so require internet connection.

> **NOTE**: Most samples set property `sync=false` in video sink element to disable real-time synchronization and run pipeline as fast as possible. Change to `sync=true` to run pipeline with real-time speed.

## Running on remote machine

In order to run samples on remote machine over SSH with X Forwarding you should force usage of `ximagesink` as video sink first:
```sh
source ./force_ximagesink.sh
```
