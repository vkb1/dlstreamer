# Optimizer
DLS Optimizer is a tool for helping users discover more optimal versions of the pipelines they run on DL Streamer. It will explore different modifications to your pipeline that are known to increase performance and measure them. As a result, you can expect to receive a pipeline that is better suited to your setup.

Optimizations involve modifying inference elements that are part of DL Streamer, as well as searching for pre- and post-processing elements better suited for the pipeline.

Modification of inference elements currently covers:
- Discovering more suitable devices
- Adjusting the batching of frames in an element
- Adjusting the number of inference requests done simultaneously (nireqs)

## Limitations
Currently the DLS Optimizer focuses mainly on DL Streamer elements, specifically the `gvadetect` and `gvaclassify`. The produced pipeline could still have potential for further optimization by transforming other elements.

Multi-stream pipelines (those utilizing the `tee` element) are also currently not supported.

## Prerequisites
Before using the DLS Optimizer, ensure you have: 
- Installed DL Streamer [intallation steps.](../get_started/install/install_guide_ubuntu.md)
- Installed any necessary [DLStreamer python dependencies.](./advanced_install/advanced_install_guide_compilation.html#step-10-install-python-dependencies-optional) 
- Configured environment variables for the current terminal session.
- Installed the OpenVINO python library.

```bash
   python3 -m venv ~/python3venv
   source ~/python3venv/bin/activate
   source /opt/intel/dlstreamer/scripts/setup_dls_env.sh
   cd /opt/intel/dlstreamer/scripts/optimizer
   pip install openvino==2026.2
```

## Using the optimizer as a tool
>**Note**\
>This example assumes your working directory is the optimizer directory `/opt/intel/dlstreamer/scripts/optimizer`
```
python3 . MODE [OPT] -- PIPELINE

Arguments:
  MODE      The type of optimization that will be performed on the pipeline.
            Possible values are \"fps\" and \"streams\".

            fps - the optimizer will explore possible alternatives
                  for the pipeline, trying to locate versions that
                  have increased performance measured by fps.

            streams - the optimizer will explore possible alternatives
                      for the pipeline, trying to locate a version which
                      can support the most streams at once without
                      crossing a minimum fps threshold.
                      (check \"multistream-fps-limit for more info)

  PIPELINE  A string representing a pipeline in the GStreamer notation
            which the tool will attempt to optimize.

Options:
    --search-duration SEARCH_DURATION   How long should the optimizer search for better pipelines.
    --sample-duration SAMPLE_DURATION   How long should every pipeline be sampled for performance.
    --detection-threshold THRESHOLD     Minimum threshold of detections that tested pipelines are
                                        not allowed to cross in order to count as valid alternatives.
    --multistream-fps-limit LIMIT       Minimum fps limit which streams are not allowed to cross
                                        when optimizing for a multi-stream scenario.
    --enable-cross-stream-batching      Enable cross stream batching for inference elements in fps mode.
    --allowed-devices ALLOWED_DEVICES   List of allowed devices (CPU, GPU, NPU) to be used by the optimizer.
                                        If not specified, all available, detected devices will be used.
                                        Tool does not support discrete GPU selection.
                                        eg.--allowed-devices CPU NPU,--allowed-devices GPU
    --batch-sizes BATCH_SIZES [BATCH_SIZES ...]
                                        List of batch sizes to be considered by the optimizer.
    --nireq-sizes NIREQ_SIZES [NIREQ_SIZES ...]
                                        List of nireq sizes to be considered by the optimizer.
    --optimization-profile PROFILE       Configuration preset for optimization behavior.
                                        Possible values: coarse, fine, default.
    --log-level LEVEL                   Configure the logging detail level.
    -v, --verbose                       Print information about every candidate pipeline investigated during
                                        optimization process.
    -o, --output OUTPUT_FILE            Save optimization results to a file in JSON format.
```
**`search-duration`** default: `300` seconds \
Increasing the **search duration** will increase the chances of discovering more performant pipelines.

**`sample-duration`** default: `10` seconds \
Increasing the **sample duration** will improve the stability of the search.

**`multistream-fps-limit`** default: `30` fps \
Increasing the **multi-stream fps limit** will improve the performance of each individual stream,
but the final result is liable to support less streams overall.

**`enable-cross-stream-batching`** \
Levy the inference instance feature of DL Streamer to batch work across multiple streams in fps mode.

**`allowed-devices`** \
Allows you to limit the set of devices that will be considered during the optimization process.

**`batch-sizes`** default: `1 2 4 8 16 32` \
Defines candidate `batch-size` values that can be applied to supported inference elements while searching.

**`nireq-sizes`** default: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8` \
Defines candidate `nireq` values that can be applied to supported inference elements while searching.

**`optimization-profile`** default: `default` \
Selects a preset that controls optimization aggressiveness and runtime.

- `coarse` - fast search with minimal exploration (uses short timings and disables `batch-sizes`/`nireq-sizes` exploration).
- `fine` - balanced search with focused exploration (`batch-sizes`: `1 4 8`, `nireq-sizes`: `4 8`).
- `default` - full search using user-provided values for `search-duration`, `sample-duration`, `batch-sizes`, and `nireq-sizes`.


>**Note**\
>When `--optimization-profile` is `coarse` or `fine`, the tool uses profile-specific values for search configuration. In these profiles, user-provided `--batch-sizes`, `--nireq-sizes`, and timing flags are being overridden by the selected preset.

**`log-level`** default: `INFO` \
Available **log levels** are: CRITICAL, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG.

**`verbose`** \
Prints extra information about the candidate pipelines which were examined during the optimization process.

**`output`** \
Provide a path representing a file which will be used to save results information in JSON format.

>**Note**\
>Search duration and sample duration both affect the amount of pipelines that will be explored during the search. \
>The total amount should be approximately `search_duration / sample_duration` pipelines.


## Pausing and resuming
While the optimizer is running, you can pause and resume the search at any time by pressing the **Spacebar** in the terminal where the tool is running.

**Pausing** stops the current pipeline sample mid-run and suspends the search loop. The optimizer will not start any new pipeline test until it is resumed. **Resuming** (pressing Space again) continues to loop through the candidates starting from the next one. The remaining **search duration** is preserved accurately: time spent while paused is not counted against the budget.

>**Note**\
>The pause key is only active while the optimizer is running as a CLI tool in terminal with keyboard input available. It is not available in non-interactive or piped environments.

## Example

```
 python3 . fps -- urisourcebin buffer-size=4096 uri=https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/1192116/1192116-sd_640_360_30fps.mp4 ! decodebin ! gvadetect model=/home/optimizer/models/public/yolo11s/INT8/yolo11s.xml ! queue ! gvawatermark ! fakesink

[__main__] [    INFO] - Best found pipeline: urisourcebin buffer-size=4096 uri=https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/1192116/1192116-sd_640_360_30fps.mp4 !decodebin3!gvadetect model=/home/optimizer/models/public/yolo11s/INT8/yolo11s.xml device=GPU pre-process-backend=va-surface-sharing batch-size=2 nireq=2 ! queue ! gvawatermark ! fakesink with fps: 81.987923.2
```
In this case the optimizer started with a pipeline that ran at ~45fps, and found a pipeline that ran at ~82fps instead. The specific improvements were:
 - replacing the `decodebin` with the `decodebin3` element.
 - configuring the `gvadetect` element to use GPU for processing
 - setting the `batch-size` parameter to 2
 - setting the `nireq` parameter to 2

## Using the optimizer as a library

The easiest way of importing the optimizer into your scripts is to include it in your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable: \
```export PYTHONPATH=/opt/intel/dlstreamer/scripts/optimizer```

Targets which are exported in order to facilitate usage inside of scripts:

### `preprocess_pipeline(pipeline) -> processed_pipeline`
- `pipeline: string` - A string containing a valid DL Streamer pipeline.
- `processed_pipeline: string` - A string containing the pipeline with all relevant substitutions.

Perform quick search and replace for known combinations of elements with more performant alternatives.

optimized_pipeline, result = optimizer.optimize_for_fps(pipeline, search_duration = 600)
print("Best discovered pipeline: " + optimized_pipeline)
print("Measured fps: " + str(result["fps"]))
```

## Controling the measurement
The point at which performance is being measured can be controlled by pre-emptively inserting a `gvafpscounter` element into your pipeline definition. For pipelines which lack such an element, the measurement is done after the last inference element supported by the optimizer tool.
