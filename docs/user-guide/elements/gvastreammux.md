# gvastreammux

Muxes multiple streams into a single pipeline so that one downstream consumer can serve N input
sources, replacing N independent pipelines and significantly reducing GPU memory usage. For
all-video inputs this means a shared `gvadetect`; the element also supports **heterogeneous**
inputs (e.g. video + lidar). Each output buffer is tagged with `GstAnalyticsBatchMeta` so that
`gvastreamdemux` can later route it back to the correct source.

## Overview

`gvastreammux` collects frames from multiple sink pads into per-pad queues, assembles
**PTS-aligned batches**, and emits each batch downstream. The single `src` pad adapts its output
to the mix of sink-pad media types — see [Output Modes](#output-modes). Every output buffer
carries a `GstAnalyticsBatchMeta` whose `streams[].index` identifies the originating pad(s) and
`n_streams` records the batch size.

Key design points:

- **PTS-anchor batch assembly** — for each batch the element picks the earliest PTS across all
  non-EOS pads as the *anchor*, then waits up to `max-wait-time` for the other pads to deliver
  buffers whose PTS lies within `pts-tolerance` of that anchor. Pads that miss the window do
  not block the batch indefinitely; they simply do not contribute to that cycle.
- **Back-pressure on upstream** — each pad has its own bounded queue (`max-queue-size`).
  When a queue is full, the upstream chain function blocks until the output loop drains it.
  This prevents unbounded memory growth without dropping frames.
- **Late-frame dropping** — if a buffer's PTS is more than `pts-tolerance` *behind* the most
  recent pushed batch, it is dropped (the batch already moved past that time and there is no
  way to insert it).
- **Per-pad PTS normalization (`sync-mode`)** — when sources have unrelated PTS timelines
  (e.g. files starting at different timestamps, multiple cameras with independent clocks),
  the element can normalize PTS before scheduling. See the [Sync Mode](#sync-mode) section.
- **Sparse pad indices** — names like `mux.sink_5` work even if `sink_0..sink_4` were never
  created. Indices must be in `[0, 256)`.

> **Important**: each source contributes one buffer per batch, so a downstream
> `gvadetect inference-interval=N` (with N > 1) skips every Nth buffer in arrival order, which
> means certain source ids will always be skipped. Use `inference-interval=1` (the default)
> when the goal is uniform coverage across all input streams.

## How It Works

1. The pipeline requests sink pads (`sink_0`, `sink_1`, ...) — one per input source. Pad
   index is parsed from the requested name; sparse indices are allowed up to 255.
2. Upstream chain functions push buffers into per-pad queues. If a pad's queue is full, the
   chain function blocks until the output task drains it (back-pressure to upstream).
3. The output task on the src pad assembles batches in three phases:
   - **Phase 1 (anchor selection)** — pick the earliest valid PTS across all non-EOS pad
     queue heads as `batch_anchor_pts`.
   - **Phase 2 (wait for contributors)** — wait up to `max-wait-time` for every non-EOS
     pad to have a head buffer with `|pts - anchor| ≤ pts-tolerance`. Exit early once all
     eligible pads contribute.
   - **Phase 3 (collect & push)** — pop one matching buffer per pad, attach
     `GstAnalyticsBatchMeta`, push downstream in pad-index order.
4. EOS on a sink pad is honored only once that pad's queue is drained: buffers already enqueued
   before EOS are still batched (so the last frames of a stream, or a single-frame source, are
   not lost). A pad with no remaining buffers and EOS set is excluded from future batches. When
   all pads are EOS and all queues are drained, the src pad emits EOS and the task pauses.
5. Per-pad `FLUSH_START` / `FLUSH_STOP` events are coalesced — the downstream flush, task
   pause, queue reset and task restart each happen exactly once per flush cycle no matter
   how many sink pads receive the events.

## Output Modes

The output mode is selected explicitly by the `output-mode` property (default `passthrough`);
there is no auto-detection from the input media types. The element negotiates its `src` caps
**once**, after every live sink pad has reported its caps, and the output loop does not push
anything until then.

| Mode (`output-mode`) | Output |
|----------------------|--------|
| **`passthrough`** (default) | Each source buffer is pushed as-is, tagged with a single-stream `GstAnalyticsBatchMeta` (`streams[0].index` = source id). This is the legacy behavior — existing `gvastreammux ! gvadetect` pipelines are unaffected. All sink pads **must negotiate identical caps**: the element compares the pads' caps for equality (it does *not* inspect the media type) and posts an error if they differ. The shared sink caps become the `src` caps. |
| **`container`** | Each assembled batch is packed into **one** container buffer with caps `multistream/x-analytics-batch(meta:GstAnalyticsBatchMeta)`. The `GstAnalyticsBatchMeta` holds one `GstAnalyticsBatchStream` per contributing source; each stream carries that source's buffer (`objects[0]`) and its original caps (a `GST_EVENT_CAPS` sticky event). Caps may differ across pads, so this is the mode for **heterogeneous** sources (e.g. video + lidar). Use `gvastreamdemux` downstream to unpack the container back into per-source pads. |

> **Important (`container` mode):** a container buffer is *not* raw video, so no video element
> (`gvadetect`, `gvawatermark`, …) may follow the mux directly. Insert `gvastreamdemux` to recover
> the per-source streams (e.g. video → `gvadetect`, lidar → `g3dinference`) first.

> **Choosing the mode:** use `passthrough` when every source produces the same caps (the common
> all-video case) and you want plain buffers downstream. Use `container` whenever the sources are
> heterogeneous (mixed media types or differing caps) — a `passthrough` mux with mismatched sink
> caps will error out at caps negotiation.

`passthrough` mode keeps the historical one-buffer-per-source-per-batch shape; `container` mode is
one-buffer-per-batch carrying all sources.

## Properties

| Property        | Type     | Default     | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `max-fps`       | Double   | `0`         | Output rate cap (0 = unlimited). Only set for local file sources; setting on RTSP/live sources can stall the pipeline. |
| `pts-tolerance` | UInt64 (ns) | `20000000` (20 ms) | Max `\|pts - anchor\|` for a buffer to count as contributing to the current batch. |
| `max-wait-time` | UInt64 (ns) | `40000000` (40 ms) | Max time the output task waits for late pads after the anchor is set. After timeout the partial batch is pushed. |
| `max-queue-size`| UInt    | `2`         | Maximum buffers per pad queue. When reached, upstream blocks (back-pressure). |
| `sync-mode`     | Enum    | `none`      | How to normalize PTS across pads. See [Sync Mode](#sync-mode). |
| `output-mode`   | Enum    | `passthrough` | `passthrough` (all sink pads must share identical caps) or `container` (one multistream batch buffer per batch). See [Output Modes](#output-modes). |

### Sync Mode

Multi-source pipelines often deliver buffers with PTS values that cannot be compared directly
(different file starts, multiple cameras with independent clocks, etc.). Without normalization
the anchor + tolerance scheduler either deadlocks (a far-future pad never matches the window
and back-pressures upstream) or oscillates (anchor jumps each round, batches end up
single-stream). `sync-mode` selects the normalization policy.

| Mode        | What it does                                                                 | Typical use case |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `none`      | Use buffer PTS as-is. Default; preserves legacy behavior.                    | Single source, or upstream already aligned (e.g. `videorate`). |
| `first-pts` | Subtract each pad's first observed PTS so every pad starts at 0.             | Multiple file sources whose PTS bases differ. |
| `segment`   | Subtract each pad's `GST_EVENT_SEGMENT` start.                               | Standard GStreamer pipelines, including seek/trick mode. |
| `pipeline`  | Overwrite PTS with `clock.now() - base_time` (pipeline running time).        | Single-machine multi-live source where source PTS are unreliable. |
| `ntp`       | Replace PTS with `GstReferenceTimestampMeta.timestamp` if the buffer carries one. | Cross-device cameras synchronized via NTP/PTP, paired with `rtspsrc add-reference-timestamp-meta=true`. |

Per-pad normalization state (first PTS, segment start) is reset on `FLUSH_STOP` and on
`PAUSED → READY`, so seek and pipeline restart establish fresh baselines.

## Buffer Metadata

Each output buffer carries a `GstAnalyticsBatchMeta`. The way it is populated depends on the
[output mode](#output-modes):

**PASSTHROUGH (video-only):** one buffer per source, single-stream meta.

| Field                  | Type     | Description |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `streams[0].index`     | guint    | Source pad index this buffer originated from. |
| `n_streams`            | gsize    | Number of contributing pads in the batch this buffer is part of. |

**CONTAINER (heterogeneous):** one container buffer per batch, `n_streams` entries.

| Field                       | Type     | Description |
|-----------------------------|----------|-------------|
| `n_streams`                 | gsize    | Number of sources packed in this batch. |
| `streams[i].index`          | guint    | Source pad index of the i-th packed stream. |
| `streams[i].objects[0]`     | GstBuffer| The i-th source's actual buffer. |
| `streams[i].sticky_events`  | GstEvent | The i-th source's original caps (a `GST_EVENT_CAPS`). |

`gvastreamdemux` reads this meta to route each source's buffer to the matching `src_*` pad.

## Pipeline Examples

### Local files with `max-fps`

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 \
  gvastreammux name=mux max-fps=30 \
  ! queue \
  ! gvadetect model=model.xml device=GPU \
    pre-process-backend=va-surface-sharing \
  ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! fakesink \
  filesrc location=video0.h265 ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_0 \
  filesrc location=video1.h265 ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_1
```

### Multiple files with different PTS bases (`sync-mode=first-pts`)

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 \
  gvastreammux name=mux sync-mode=first-pts max-fps=30 \
  ! queue \
  ! gvadetect model=model.xml device=GPU \
  ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! fakesink \
  filesrc location=clip-recorded-at-10am.mp4 ! qtdemux ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_0 \
  filesrc location=clip-recorded-at-2pm.mp4  ! qtdemux ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_1
```

### RTSP sources, no `max-fps`

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 \
  gvastreammux name=mux \
  ! queue \
  ! gvadetect model=model.xml device=GPU \
    pre-process-backend=va-surface-sharing \
  ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! fakesink \
  rtspsrc location=rtsp://host:8554/stream latency=200 \
  ! rtph265depay ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_0 \
  rtspsrc location=rtsp://host:8555/stream latency=200 \
  ! rtph265depay ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_1
```

### Multi-camera NTP/PTP synchronization (`sync-mode=ntp`)

When sources are real IP cameras synchronized via NTP (and the SDP advertises an RFC7273
clock), set `rtspsrc add-reference-timestamp-meta=true` so each buffer carries a
`GstReferenceTimestampMeta` with absolute time, then let the mux use that as PTS:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 \
  gvastreammux name=mux sync-mode=ntp pts-tolerance=33000000 \
  ! queue ! gvadetect model=model.xml device=GPU \
  ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! fakesink \
  rtspsrc location=rtsp://cam1 ntp-sync=true add-reference-timestamp-meta=true \
  ! rtph265depay ! h265parse ! avdec_h265 ! mux.sink_0 \
  rtspsrc location=rtsp://cam2 ntp-sync=true add-reference-timestamp-meta=true \
  ! rtph265depay ! h265parse ! avdec_h265 ! mux.sink_1
```

`pts-tolerance` is widened above the typical inter-frame interval to accommodate per-camera
network jitter; tune it for your environment.

### Pair with `gvastreamdemux` for per-source output

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 \
  gvastreammux name=mux max-fps=30 \
  ! queue \
  ! gvadetect model=model.xml device=GPU \
  ! gvastreamdemux name=demux \
  demux.src_0 ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! fakesink \
  demux.src_1 ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! fakesink \
  filesrc location=video0.h265 ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_0 \
  filesrc location=video1.h265 ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_1
```

### Heterogeneous sources: video + lidar (CONTAINER mode)

Heterogeneous sources (here lidar via `g3dlidarparse` alongside video) require
[CONTAINER mode](#output-modes), selected with `output-mode=container`. The container batch must be
unpacked by `gvastreamdemux` before any per-stream processing — no `gvadetect` may sit between the
mux and demux. In this example each demuxed branch goes straight to `fakesink` (`src_0`/`src_1` =
video, `src_2` = lidar):

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 -e \
  gvastreammux name=mux output-mode=container sync-mode=first-pts \
  ! queue \
  ! gvastreamdemux name=demux \
  demux.src_0 ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! fakesink \
  demux.src_1 ! queue ! gvafpscounter ! fakesink \
  demux.src_2 ! queue ! fakesink \
  filesrc location=video0.h265 ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_0 \
  filesrc location=video1.h265 ! h265parse ! vah265dec ! mux.sink_1 \
  multifilesrc location=velodyne/%06d.bin start-index=0 caps=application/octet-stream \
  ! g3dlidarparse frame-rate=10 ! mux.sink_2
```

> Lidar typically runs at a lower rate (e.g. 10 fps) than video (e.g. 30 fps). With aligned PTS,
> batches that have a coincident lidar frame carry it (`n_streams` includes the lidar pad);
> video-only intervals produce video-only batches. Ensure the lidar branch produces valid PTS
> (`g3dlidarparse frame-rate=...`) and pick a `sync-mode` so the two timelines are comparable.

## Tuning Notes

- `pts-tolerance` should comfortably accommodate the largest expected inter-source PTS drift
  *after* normalization. For 30 fps sources a value of 16–33 ms is a reasonable starting point.
- `max-wait-time` bounds the worst-case batch latency when one pad stops delivering. Set it
  somewhat above one frame interval (e.g. 40–50 ms for 30 fps) so transient stalls do not
  immediately break the batch.
- `max-queue-size` controls the back-pressure depth. Larger values absorb more upstream
  bursts at the cost of memory; 2–4 is usually enough.
